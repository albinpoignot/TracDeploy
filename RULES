This file aims to give all the conventions used by the developpers in the 
project.

  #### Part 1 : Graphical style

    ¤ Gold rules
      - Every time you change style, put ${NC} to the end of the echo to be 
      sure to give back the same env to futur developpers
      - Respect the given conventions to leave the scripts easy to used
      - Delete the maximum of lines displayed by others programs. This tools is
      designed to simplify the deployement, not for technical details. This
      kind of display will come later.

    ¤ Question to a user :
      echo -e "${Purple}<QUESTION> [ <[default value]> ]${NC}"
    
    ¤ Error in the user answer :
      echo -e "${Red}<QUESTION 2> [ <[default value]> ]${NC}"
    
    ¤ A step in the script :
      echo -e "${Yellow} Step <number> on <number> : <step desc>${NC}"
    
    ¤ End of a step :
      echo -e "${LightBlue}--> ${Bold}${Green}Done${NC}\n"

    ¤ Substep :

	echo -e "${Green}\t* ${NC}<substep desc>"
      
      If it's a "warning" substep :
	echo -e "${Yellow}\t* ${NC}<substep desc>"
