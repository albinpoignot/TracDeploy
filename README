TracDeploy is about give an easy to deploy Trac without a graphical user interface, on Linux systems.

It's created for Gentoo based systems, and actually being tested on a Sabayon (v6). However, it should be cross-platform if you don't use the "Init packages"
par which is the only one part dependent of the system.

**PLEASE TAKE A LOOK ON THE WIKI !!**

If any question, or something else like critics, tell me :)
