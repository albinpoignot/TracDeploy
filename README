TracDeploy is about give an easy to deploy Trac without a graphical user interface, on Linux systems.

It's created for Gentoo based systems, and actually being tested on a Sabayon (v6). However, it should be cross-platform if you don't use the "Init packages"
par which is the only one part dependent of the system.

In this time, you require this tools (all other can be installed by the "Init packages part" :

  - perl



To launch the tools, use this command :

  ./MANAGE_TRAC.sh [</path/to/trac/env> [</path/to/svn/repo>]]



If any question, or something else like critics, tell me :)
